// envelope), §7.3–§7.6 (certificates and statements), §8.3 (authorization
// context block), and §8.4 (Noise prologue).
//
// Every encoder here follows the convention the pre-existing node-identity
// encoders set (`nodeIdentity.ts`) and §7.1 restates: validate the inputs,
// canonicalize what has a canonical form, and emit a canonical-CBOR (§3.6)
// definite-length array whose FIRST element is the structure's domain string
// (§3.5). Domain separation lives entirely in the encoders — the node identity
// signing interface signs whatever bytes it is handed, so a structure that
// reached it without a distinct domain would be an attacker-influenced signing
// oracle (§7.2).
//
// NO CONSUMER MAY BUILD TO-BE-SIGNED BYTES AD HOC (§7.2). The signing inputs of
// this protocol are exactly the outputs of the encoders below and of the two
// pre-existing node-identity encoders, and nothing else may be handed to the
// node identity key or to the mobile device key.
//
// Fingerprints are always RECOMPUTED here, never accepted as inputs: §7.1 says a
// verifier MUST recompute every fingerprint it consumes from the
// algorithm-labelled raw public key, and an encoder that took one as a parameter
// would let a caller sign a key under another key's fingerprint. The single
// place a CARRIED fingerprint is an input is the §7.6 cross-signature
// reconstruction, which §7.6 fixes to rebuild the §7.3 array from the
// statement's carried element 6 rather than from a re-derivation — and which
// recomputes that fingerprint anyway and refuses a disagreement, so no
// fingerprint is ever accepted on the carrier's authority.
//
// Encoders throw `RelayE2eeValidationError`; the reachable causes are local
// programming errors and structures a peer supplied that this protocol will not
// represent at all. The one exception is the §7.6.1 bound the §7.6 encoder
// applies to its own output, which throws the `RelayE2eeCapabilityBoundError`
// subclass NAMING the bound, because that failure is the node's own
// configuration rather than peer input. Validators over peer-supplied
// structures — the continuity chain, the canonical-CBOR decode — return typed
// results instead, matching `relayE2eeWire.ts`: those are conditions the caller
// maps onto a §11 row.
//
// Like `relayE2eeConstants.ts` and `relayE2eeKeys.ts` this module is free of
// Node built-ins, because the web and native clients both validate node-signed
// statements and the native client signs its own §7.4 certificate. That is why
// `canonicalizeE2eeHubOrigin` restates the node-identity canonicalization rather
// than importing it from `nodeIdentity.ts`, which imports `node:crypto`;
// `relayE2eeTranscripts.test.ts` pins the two to agree, accepted origin for
// accepted origin and rejected origin for rejected origin.
