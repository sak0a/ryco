// invocation), §9.2 (receiver-state sequencing), §9.3 (sender rules), §9.4
// (epoch key schedule and rekey ratchet), §9.5 (erasure), and §9.6 (exhaustion).
//
// This is the layer between the handshake and the application: `relayE2eeNoise`
// hands over three values (§6.5), this module turns them into the two
// directional epoch schedules, and every byte the application sends or receives
// on an `e2ee` channel passes through `protect` or `unprotect` below.
//
// IT OWNS NO FRAMING AND NO STATE MACHINE. The envelope layout, the inner-record
// framing, the AEAD nonce, and the AAD are `relayE2eeWire`'s (§3.3) and are
// REUSED here rather than rebuilt — a second construction of a nonce or an AAD
// is a second chance to disagree with the peer. The mode machine (§4.4), the
// close machine (§10), and the `E2EEError` body (§11.3) are not here either;
// what is here is the part of their behavior §9 fixes: close and error records
// consume the same directional sequence as RPC records, they count toward the
// same thresholds, and §9.6 reserves capacity for them.
//
// Epochs and counters are `bigint` throughout, per §3.1 and §9.3. The per-epoch
// usage counters are `number`, deliberately: they are bounded by
// `E2EE_REKEY_MAX_RECORDS` and by `E2EE_REKEY_MAX_BYTES` plus one record, both
// far below `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, and they are usage accounting rather than
// wire values — nothing derived from them reaches a nonce.
//
// RESULTS ARE TYPED FOR PEER INPUT AND THROWN FOR LOCAL MISTAKES, as in
// `relayE2eeWire`: every reason `unprotect` returns is a condition the caller
// maps onto a §11.3 row, and every throw here is reachable only from a local
// programming error.

//
// THE OWNERSHIP RULE OF EVERY MODULE THAT HOLDS §6.5 OR §9.4 KEY MATERIAL, of
// which this one holds the most. One defect produces every violation of §9.5
// this implementation has had: key material is acquired, and then a statement
// that can throw runs before anything is in a position to erase it. The buffer
// that survives such a throw belongs to nobody — no object owns it, no caller
// may touch it — and it lives, unzeroed, to the end of the process.
//
// A constructor, a factory, or a method that takes ownership therefore has
// exactly two admissible shapes:
//
//   (a) ACQUIRE LAST. Every validation and every fallible derivation runs
//       BEFORE the first byte is acquired, and nothing after the acquisition
//       can throw. A failure then acquires nothing and there is nothing to
//       erase. PREFER THIS: it removes the failure mode rather than handling
//       it. `DirectionalRecordState`, `#protectCommitted`'s buffered plaintext,
//       and `relayE2eeNoise`'s handshake constructor are built this way.
//
//   (b) ONE FUNNEL. The acquisition and every fallible statement after it sit
//       inside `ownE2eeSecrets`, which erases on any throw — with no statement
//       between the acquisition and the funnel's start, and nothing fallible
//       after its end. This is the shape for an ownership transfer the caller
//       cannot take back, where (a) would only strand the same buffer one frame
//       further up the stack: `e2eeSessionSecretsFromNoiseKeys` takes ownership
//       with the CALL, so its funnel starts with the call.
//
// Every erasure helper below is TOTAL: it never throws, whatever it is handed.
// Erasure runs on failure paths, and a caller must see the failure that brought
// it there rather than one raised while cleaning up after it.
