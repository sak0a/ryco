/**
 * The shared bounded-cache eviction policy: a count cap and a byte budget,
 * OR-triggered (either cap being exceeded starts eviction) and AND-satisfied
 * (eviction stops only when both are back within budget), evicting the least
 * recently used evictable entries first. Extracted from the thread-detail
 * subscription cache in supervision.ts so the mobile snapshot cache bounds
 * itself with the same policy instead of inventing a second one.
 *
 * Pure planning only: the caller enumerates its entries and disposes the
 * returned keys, so the same policy serves a synchronous in-memory map and an
 * async SQLite store alike.
