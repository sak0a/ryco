// K1–K24, the §4.4 send-buffer disposition, the §4.4 timers, and the §8.5/§8.8
// wiring of the shared client handshake onto the real relay path.
//
// IT IS THE STRUCTURAL MIRROR of the node's `NodeE2eeChannelSession` mode
// machine, and divergence that the direction does not force is a defect rather
// than a style: the two endpoints implement the same normative table from

//
// WHAT THIS OWNS: one channel's K-row dispatch, its `T_ADV`, `T_TRUST_COMMIT`,
// and `T_HANDSHAKE` deadlines, the single mode lock, and the mapping of every
// pre-key fatal condition onto §11.2's observable. It verifies no statement (§5.2 lives in
// `relayE2eeCapabilityVerify`), derives no key and builds no hello body (§8 lives
// in `E2eeClientHandshake`), classifies no selection (§12.1.1 is client-anchored
// state the caller resolves before the channel exists), and protects no record
// (§9 and §10 live in `relayE2eeChannel`).
//
// THE ONE RULE WORTH STATING AS A PROPERTY OF THE CODE RATHER THAN OF A COMMENT:
// §11.2 says "a client executing FATAL-PRE sends nothing and closes". There is
// therefore NO reject-emitting branch anywhere in this module — not a guarded
// one, not a dead one. The only bytes it ever puts on the wire are one
// `E2EEClientHello` on row K1, and every fatal path funnels through `fatalPre`,
// which emits nothing at all.
