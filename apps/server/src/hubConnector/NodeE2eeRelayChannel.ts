// payloads — docs/relay-e2ee-protocol.md §4.5 (the size budget), §10 (the
// authenticated close), and §10.4 (the truncation verdict).
//
// WHAT THIS OWNS: nothing about the protocol. It decides no policy, protects no
// record, and names no close reason. It exists because the two facts below are
// the whole of what a channel's lifecycle owes the E2EE layer, and both were
// previously spelled out inline in the connector layer, where nothing could
// reach them:
//
//   - a channel that ends MUST be given §10's authenticated close before its
//     session is disposed, and
//   - the verdict §10.4 records depends on whether the relay chunk assembler
//     still holds an incomplete reassembled message at that instant.
