/**
 * AgentControlSessionRegistry - In-memory credential and lease authority
 * for the internal provider-session MCP surface.
 *
 * Every supported provider runtime receives a fresh opaque bearer bound to
 * exactly one `(threadId, providerInstanceId, runtimeSessionId)` runtime
 * epoch and a fixed capability grant set. The registry is deliberately
 * memory-only: credentials do not survive a server restart, are stored
 * only as digests, and are never persisted or logged. Revocation is
 * synchronous — a revoked session's in-flight MCP requests are aborted and
 * later requests fail authentication indistinguishably from never-issued
 * credentials.
 *
 * The registry also owns two adjacent responsibilities:
 *
 *   - The private MCP endpoint slot. The loopback listener publishes its
 *     address here and clears it on teardown; provider adapters only ever
 *     learn the endpoint through an issued lease, so the address never
 *     reaches browser/client runtime state.
 *   - Exact-turn write authority (consumed by the proposal-backed thread
 *     actions slice). This PR ships the lease API — bind, synchronous
 *     retirement, in-flight cancellation — but no write tool exercises it.
 *
 * @module AgentControlSessionRegistry
