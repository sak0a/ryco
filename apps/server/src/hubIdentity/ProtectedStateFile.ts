 * cheaper way to learn that a foreign holder finished — but it is the wrong
 * mechanism for two callers inside one process, which is the contended case

 * on the per-channel path, so a burst of new channels is a burst of same-process
 * acquisitions of the same three records. Left to the poll alone, each waiter
 * backs off to `LOCK_POLL_MAX_MS` and the burst serializes at roughly one
 * acquisition per poll interval, with no ordering: a late arrival that happens
 * to wake first wins, and an early one can be passed over repeatedly.
 *
 * Queueing them here makes the handoff immediate — the next waiter is resumed in
 * the same turn the holder releases, with no timer in between — and makes it
 * FAIR, because the queue is first-in-first-out and a release hands ownership
 * directly to the head rather than reopening a race. The file lock still governs
 * cross-process exclusion; this only decides which local caller gets to hold it.
 *
 * KEYED BY PATH, not by instance, because two `ProtectedStateFile` handles on
 * one path in one process are the same contention (tests open a record twice;
 * so does a reopened store). The deadline is shared with the cross-process wait,
 * so total wait time is still bounded by `LOCK_WAIT_MS` and a reentrant call
 * still reports `locked` at that deadline rather than deadlocking.
