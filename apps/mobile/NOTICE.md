# Third-party notices — @ryco/mobile

The `apps/mobile` scaffold — the Expo/React Native app shell and its build
configuration (`app.config.ts`, `metro.config.js`, `babel.config.js`,
`index.ts`, `global.css`, `eas.json`, the `plugins/*` config plugins, and the
platform/runtime wiring modeled on them) — was copied and stripped from
[`pingdotgg/t3code`](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) at commit `67a7b1a1`
(originally `apps/mobile`). It was re-namespaced from T3 to Ryco identifiers,
re-themed, and had the T3-proprietary planes (the hosted-auth vendor and managed
cloud, EAS project/owner, brand assets, telemetry endpoint, widgets, share
extension, quick actions, and the camera-showcase rig) removed for the Ryco MVP.

The B2 screen layer copied from the same upstream reference at the same commit
extends this copy: the native JS view wrappers (`src/native/*`), the shared UI
primitives (`src/components/*`), the shared helpers (`src/lib/*`), the review
diff/highlighting modules (`src/features/review/*`), the hardware-keyboard
command registry (`src/features/keyboard/*`), and the appearance text-scaling hook
(`src/features/settings/appearance/*`) were copied and stripped the same way —
re-namespaced from T3 to Ryco identifiers (including the native view names
`RycoComposerEditor` / `RycoNativeControls` / `RycoKeyboardCommands` /
`RycoReviewDiffSurface`), re-themed to the `font-ryco-*` utilities, and with the
brand marks, cloud plane, showcase rig, and asset-runtime dependencies removed.
Attribution is kept here (not as in-file headers) so the T3 identifiers do not
re-enter `src`.
