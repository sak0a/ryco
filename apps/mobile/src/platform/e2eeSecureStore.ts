/**
 * The device-only keychain namespace that holds relay-E2EE private material —
 * `docs/relay-e2ee-protocol.md` §6.3 (custody by endpoint), whose native-client
 * row requires the entry to be "device-only, non-synchronizing, excluded from
 * backup, restore, and device-transfer on both platforms", with an iOS
 * this-device-only accessibility class.
 *
 * A SECOND STORE, NOT A SETTING ON THE FIRST. `mobileSecretKV` holds the hosted
 * session token and the per-environment bearer tokens and passes NO options, so
 * those items sit in the library's default service under its default
 * accessibility. Changing that store's options would not migrate them: iOS
 * `SecItemUpdate` sends only `kSecValueData` (verified against
 * `expo-secure-store/ios/SecureStoreModule.swift`), so every already-written item
 * would silently keep its old class while new writes got the new one. The E2EE
 * material therefore gets its own `keychainService`, which is its own
 * `kSecAttrService` and its own Android keystore alias, and the bearer stores are
 * left exactly as they are.
 *
 * `requireAuthentication` IS NEVER PASSED. expo-secure-store folds that option
 * into a `.biometryCurrentSet` access control, so enrolling a new fingerprint or
 * re-registering a face destroys the key — and with it every pin the device
 * holds. That is the same reason the device-key module chose
 * `setUserAuthenticationRequired(false)`. Device unlock, not biometry re-enrolment
 * survivability, is the property this material needs.
 *
 * THE NAMESPACE IS ENUMERABLE BY CONSTRUCTION. Callers address entries through
 * `E2eeSecureStoreKey`, a closed union of the names below, because §6.3's
 * clone/restore prohibition requires destroying the whole namespace WITHOUT
 * reading any of it first — and neither platform lets JavaScript enumerate a
 * keychain service. A closed key set is what makes "destroy everything" a
 * complete operation instead of a best-effort one.

 * secret ones, and §13.1 requires the marker to be "committed atomically with the

 * two entries, so one entry is the only construction under which a crash between
 * the promotion and the marker write cannot exist to be observed.
 *
 * It joins the closed union rather than sitting beside it: §6.3's clone/restore
 * purge destroys exactly the names listed below, and a pin set that survived a
 * reinstall while the agreement key it was taken against did not is the state
 * §13.1.1 describes as indistinguishable from a fresh install. The first-run

 * material into an item that backup and device transfer carry while looking like
 * it had asked for something stronger.
 *
 * Android: `keychainAccessible` IS AN iOS-ONLY OPTION and the constant that names
 * it is an iOS-only native constant — the Android module declares none, so
 * `SecureStore.WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` is `undefined` there and requiring
 * it would refuse every E2EE operation on the platform. Android's half of §6.3 is
 * the non-exportable keystore key plus the backup and device-transfer exclusion

 * is process memory and which has no durable store at all.
