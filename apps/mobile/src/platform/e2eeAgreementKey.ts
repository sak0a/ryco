// docs/relay-e2ee-protocol.md §6.2 (static agreement keys and cross-signatures)
// and §6.3 (custody by endpoint), whose native-client row is a device-only
// platform secure-store entry.
//
// A SIBLING OF THE DEVICE KEY, NOT AN EXTENSION OF IT, exactly as
// `NodeAgreementIdentity` is a sibling of `NodeSigningIdentity` on the node.
// §6.2's key-separation rule is absolute — the identity key never performs key
// agreement and the agreement key never signs — so THIS MODULE EXPOSES NO
// `sign`, and `deviceKey.ts` exposes no agreement. Two modules over two stores
// is what makes the rule structural rather than a comment someone has to obey.
//
// ONE KEY PER DEVICE, so the entry has a fixed name. §6.2 says "one static
// X25519 keypair per device" for the native client; the `(hubOrigin, accountId)`
// namespace is bound by the §7.4 certificate that cross-signs this key, not by
// the key itself. A fixed name is also what lets §6.3's clone/restore purge
// destroy the whole namespace without reading any of it.
//
// WHERE THIS DIFFERS FROM THE DEVICE KEY, AND WHY IT HAS TO. The device key's
// private half never crosses its module boundary — the enclave signs, and only a
// signature comes back. That is not available for key agreement: the Noise
// initiator takes the static secret as raw bytes (§8), and no platform keystore
// on either OS performs X25519. `withSecretKey` is the narrowest thing that is
// actually expressible: the scalar is live only for the duration of one
// caller-supplied function, this module zeroizes it on every exit from that
// function, and no accessor returns it.
