// The NATIVE tier's relay-E2EE provider — docs/relay-e2ee-protocol.md §4.4 (the
// client mode machine, built at `channel.accept`) plus the one thing that is
// genuinely this platform's and not the protocol's: the React Native lifecycle.
//
// WHAT THIS OWNS: the tier, the lifecycle hazard, and nothing else. The K rows,
// the timers, the buffer disposition, and the handshake all belong to
// `makeRelayE2eeInitiator`; the §12.1.1 classification, the credentials, and the
// pin all belong to the caller, which resolves them BEFORE the channel exists
// because §4.4 requires every selection guard to be evaluable "before it has
// received any payload".
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE LIFECYCLE HAZARD, STATED PLAINLY
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `T_HANDSHAKE_NODE` (10 s) runs from the NODE'S ADVERTISEMENT EMIT, not from
// `channel.accept`, and §8.9 keeps it armed through the `e2ee` state until the
// client's first envelope authenticates. A mobile client that is backgrounded
// between accept and that first envelope therefore earns an encrypted §11.3 Q8
// and a dead channel — one it cannot even read, because it is suspended. iOS
// suspends WebSockets on background, so this is the ordinary case on this
// platform rather than a corner of it.
//
// The answer is to decide the channel BEFORE the node does, and to decide it
// fail-closed: a background transition while `negotiating` is a CLIENT-INITIATED
// channel abort — FATAL-PRE, no record emitted, buffered sends discarded — and
// a channel is never opened into a backgrounded app in the first place. Neither
// is a legacy fallback: §4.4 forbids one after validated evidence and this path
// cannot know whether evidence is on its way.
