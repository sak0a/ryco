/**
 * Declare, for as long as this thread surface is mounted, that its environment
 * should be the hosted selection — and read back the reason when it cannot be.
 *
 * Deliberately the only React surface of the retarget engine, and deliberately
 * thin: all of the decision and timing logic lives in
 * `threadConnectionRetarget.ts` where it can be tested (react-native ships
 * untranspiled Flow, so no component test can ever exercise this file).
 *
 * Keyed on `environmentId`: a `StackActions.replace` between two threads on the
 * same node re-runs nothing, and a replace across nodes releases the old intent
 * and opens the new one through the engine's refcount, so the double-mount that
 * a replace (and iPad's ThreadFilesRouteScreen) produces cannot cancel an
 * intent that is still wanted.
