/**
 * Wave 3a: opening a thread re-targets the hosted connection to the node that
 * thread lives on. This module owns the decision ("should this environment
 * become the hosted selection, and if not, why not?") and the debounced,
 * cancel-safe engine that acts on it. Nothing else triggers a retarget — not
 * scroll, not inbox rendering, not prefetch.
 *
 * Two things this module deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 * - It adds no second activation or readiness path. The only way it changes the
 *   selection is `hostedHubController.selectNode`, which runs the existing
 *   fail-closed activation pipeline (ticket → relay channel → state sync →
 *   readiness gates). Readiness is observable only through the hosted store.
 * - It never treats the `selectNode` promise as a success signal.
 *   `selectNode` resolves as soon as `connectPrimaryEnvironment()` is invoked,
 *   long before any socket or handshake exists, and resolves identically on
 *   every one of its silent no-op guard returns. The intent stays pending until
 *   a store evaluation observes the selection actually landed.
