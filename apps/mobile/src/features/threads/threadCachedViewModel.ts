 * Wave 3a: what a thread detail surface renders when its content is cache

 * Every decision the screen makes about that condition lives here, because
 * `ThreadDetailScreen.tsx` imports react-native and therefore can never be
 * tested (untranspiled Flow). The screen keeps the layout; this module keeps
 * the judgement.
 *
 * Two liveness rules this encodes, both learned the hard way:
 *
 * - Cache provenance is read from `selectEnvironmentHydratedFromCacheAt`, never
 *   from the per-environment WS ui-state. A demoted environment's socket slot is
 *   reset on dispose and then reads "connecting" forever, so keying the cached
 *   treatment on it would leave a cached thread presenting as a live one that is
 *   merely slow.
 * - A degraded retarget always produces a banner. The acceptance criterion for
 *   this wave is that an unselectable node's thread opens "read-only from cache
 *   with a stated reason, and does not hang" — a silent surface with a spinner
 *   is the exact failure the reason copy exists to prevent.
