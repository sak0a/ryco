/**
 * Native account management for the hosted plane.
 *
 * Every credential operation on this surface is a **direct, DPoP-bound call**
 * through `hostedHubController`. Nothing here opens a browser. The sign-in
 * sheet uses the reviewed system-browser handoff, while `/api/account/*` is
 * served to the native transport, so credential *management* has no reason to
 * leave the app.
 *
 * Like `hostedAuthModel.ts` this module is free of `react-native` and of React:
 * the RN packages ship untranspiled Flow that the vp/node runner cannot parse,
 * so every decision — which rows exist, when an action is refused, what each
 * confirmation destroys, and which controller call sits behind every button —
 * lives here and is asserted by a real test. The `.tsx` files are layout.
 *
 * Five rules this module exists to hold:
 *
 * 1. **Step-up is discovered, never assumed.** Neither the client type nor the
 *    Hub says whether the current session came from a passkey or from a
 *    password / recovery code / email link. So an action is attempted, and only
 *    the runtime's distinguishable refusal turns on a TOTP field — see
 *    {@link isHostedStepUpMessage}.
 * 2. **Recovery-code regeneration rotates.** It invalidates codes the user has
 *    already saved, so it runs from one explicit, confirmed submit and from
 *    nothing else — never a mount, focus, retry, or reconnect. No derivation in
 *    this file calls an action; every call is inside a button's `run`.
 * 3. **The one-shot secrets are transient, but it is the user who ends them.**
 *    The TOTP enrolment secret and the recovery codes live in one in-memory
 *    runtime slot each; the secret is projected into exactly one view (the
 *    enrolment prompt) and is dropped through `dismissTotpEnrollment()` when
 *    the user closes it. Neither is dropped by a *teardown* — see
 *    {@link leaseHostedRecoveryCodeDisplay} for why an unmount is not an
 *    acknowledgement.
 * 4. **A fallback credential is never presented as equivalent to a passkey.**
 *    The password and two-factor copy says so in as many words.
 * 5. **A result may only land on the state it was started from.** The account
 *    store cannot distinguish "committed" from "abandoned" or "the session
 *    rotated" — all three leave it idle with no error — so every submit is
 *    fenced on the prompt it belongs to, the attempt that is still live, and
 *    the session that issued it. The runtime's `createFence` is the same
 *    discipline; this is its surface-side half.
