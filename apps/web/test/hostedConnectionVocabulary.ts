 * exhaustive enumerations `connectionStatus.ts` exports.
 *
 * FIVE INPUTS, AND THE FIFTH IS THE ONE THE SHIPPED APP GAINED LAST. The
 * derivation's fifth input is the §4.4 channel state, and `apps/web` now runs a
 * §4.4 machine on every relay socket (`resolveWebRelayE2eeProvider`) and
 * publishes what it locked (`e2eeSession.ts`), which all three connection
 * surfaces read. While the sweep stopped at four, `Browser encrypted`, `Legacy`,
 * and `Securing` were unreachable in every browser render suite — so a surface
 * that dropped the dimension and rendered a §12.2 plaintext downgrade as a green
 * `Online` was indistinguishable, in these suites, from one that did not.
 *
 * The fence is elsewhere and is unaffected by any of this:
 * `src/hostedHub/connectionStatus.ts` narrows the dimension to the states this
 * tier can be in, and `src/hostedHub/connectionStatus.test.ts` sweeps all four of
 * them purely and asserts the native rows stay unreachable from here.
