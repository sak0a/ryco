 *
 * This is the structural half of separating the Hub website's design from the
 * node app's. `VITE_RYCO_CLIENT_MODE` is a build-time define (`env.ts`), so the
 * attribute is not a runtime toggle and cannot flicker: a standard build
 * compiles to a call that never stamps anything, which leaves every `hub:`
 * utility and every `:root[data-surface="hub"]` rule inert there. Hub styling
 * therefore cannot influence the node app by accident, rather than by review
 * discipline.
 *
 * Deliberately simpler than {@link syncDocumentPresentationTier}: the tier is a
 * live media classification that needs a subscription and change notification,
 * while the surface is a fixed property of the bundle. There is nothing to
 * observe and nothing to tear down.
 *
 * Scoping note: `:root[data-surface="hub"]` has specificity (0,2,0), so it wins
 * against the runtime-injected `<style id="ryco-active-theme">` — which writes
 * plain `:root{}` / `:root.dark{}` rules — regardless of source order. It does
 * NOT win against `themes/appearancePreferences.ts`, which emits the
 * `--radius-*` ramp with `!important`; Hub radii must go through that emitter
 * or use literal lengths.
