/**
 * Pure logic behind the new-thread "Work in …" sentence.
 *
 * A draft can target three places, and the underlying state already expresses
 * all three — the pairing of `envMode` and `worktreePath` is just not obvious
 * from either field alone:
 *
 * | target           | envMode    | worktreePath | branch          |
 * |------------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|
 * | project root     | "local"    | null         | current checkout|
 * | existing worktree| "local"    | "/path"      | that worktree's |
 * | a new worktree   | "worktree" | null         | base to fork    |
 *
 * This module names that mapping in one place so the sentence, its popover,
 * and the send path can't drift apart.
