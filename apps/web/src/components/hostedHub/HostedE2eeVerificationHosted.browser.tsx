// docs/relay-e2ee-protocol.md §13.5's session code in HOSTED mode, where the
// section its pointer names is not everyone's to open.
//
// THE FILE EXISTS BECAUSE THE MODE IS READ AT MODULE SCOPE. `isHostedHubMode()`
// answers a build-time flag, so a suite cannot hold both answers at once and the
// hoisted `vi.mock` below applies to the whole file — the same reason
// `NodeSecuritySettingsHosted.browser.tsx` is its own file. The sibling
// `HostedE2eeVerification.browser.tsx` runs as the standard client, where there
// is no hosted role gate and the short form is always correct.
//
// What is pinned here: the short form's second sentence is a promise about the
// reader's OWN settings dialog — "Settings → Security explains what else this
// tab cannot check" — and Settings → Security is owner-only in hosted mode
// (`settingsSections.logic.ts`), while this component draws for whoever holds a
// locked `web-unsigned` channel. A viewer, an operator, or an owner whose role
// snapshot has gone stale must therefore never be sent there, and must not lose
// §2.2's no-pin reason — which only the long form states — in the process.
