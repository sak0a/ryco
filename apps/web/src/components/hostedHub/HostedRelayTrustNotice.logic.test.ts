/**
 * THE RETIRED CLAIM, SWEPT OVER THE REPOSITORY RATHER THAN OVER A LIST OF FILES.
 *
 * This guard began as a table of (path, phrase) pairs over three files, and BOTH
 * halves of that shape were blind in the same way the browser suites are.
 *
 * Enumerating PATHS cannot see a fourth file, and the claim was in fact written
 * in eight: the three the table named, plus two approved design specs that still
 * REQUIRED it of documents this repository ships, two checklist bullets that
 * still instructed an implementer to write it, and a stale future tense in the
 * canonical relay protocol. The specs are the sharpest of those, because
 * `docs/relay-architecture.html` is not doc-only — `apps/web` imports it as a
 * Vite `?url` asset and the desktop app bundles it — so a page regenerated
 * against its governing spec would have shipped the retired claim back to users.
 *
 * Enumerating PHRASES cannot see a paraphrase. Re-wording "they are not
 * application-level end-to-end encrypted" to "hosted channels are not encrypted
 * end to end" passed every row while the file went on stating the claim.
 *
 * So this walks the repository's text files and matches SHAPES. The two sites
 * that carry the retired sentence on purpose are allowlisted by path: a negative
 * test fixture and a change record are the correct homes for a retired claim,
 * and rewording either to satisfy a scan would delete the check it exists to be.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER, so nobody reads a green run as more than
 * it is. The shapes are denials, and two neighbouring defects are not denials:
 * a requirement phrased positively ("so installing cannot be mistaken for
 * creating an end-to-end encrypted connection" — the wrong requirement, but not
 * the retired sentence), and a stale future tense ("allows LATER application-
 * level end-to-end encryption", which two historical documents quote verbatim as
 * a quotation of the relay protocol and which a scan therefore cannot forbid
 * without ordering an edit inside a quoted record). Both were corrected by hand
 * in the same change that widened this guard; neither has a mechanical check.
