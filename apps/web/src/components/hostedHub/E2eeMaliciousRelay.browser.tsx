// THE HOSTILE RELAY, in Chromium — docs/relay-e2ee-protocol.md §4.4's client
// rows driven by a peer that is trying to make this client release plaintext.
//
// The whole file is written from the Hub's side of the seam: every case is a
// thing a Hub can do to a conforming client without breaking any relay rule —
// withhold the advertisement, deliver plaintext at the wrong moment, stall,
// forge, or substitute the node's own static key. The client's answer is
// asserted as BYTES ON THE SOCKET, because §4.4's send-buffering rule is a
// statement about the relay and an assertion about an internal queue would pass
// on an implementation that emptied it onto the wire.
//
// AND IT IS STILL NOT A CLAIM AGAINST THE HUB. §2.4: the Hub serves the
// JavaScript that runs every one of these checks. What the cases below pin is
// that the SHIPPED code fails closed — which is worth having against wrong-node
// routing and non-Hub interposition, and is worth nothing against a Hub that
// simply ships different code (§2.2, §2.3, §12.1's web threat scope).
