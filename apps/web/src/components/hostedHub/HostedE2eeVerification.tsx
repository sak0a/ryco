/**
 * docs/relay-e2ee-protocol.md §13.5's `WebSAS` for the active session.
 *
 * GATED ON THE LOCK, NOT ON THE CODE. `e2eeSession.ts` publishes the string from
 * inside the §4.4 machine's own `e2ee` lock, which lands one tick before the
 * caller's post-operation sync moves the projection off `negotiating` — so a
 * code can be held while the channel has not yet been reported as locked.
 * Drawing it then would show a comparison value for a channel this surface
 * cannot yet say is encrypted.
 *
 * THE ADVISORY IS NOT BEHIND A DISCLOSURE. §13.5's duty is on "the web UI text
 * accompanying the `WebSAS`", and text a reader has to open is text most readers
 * never see. It renders in the same view as the characters, every time, and it
 * comes out of the same value they do ({@link hostedE2eeVerificationView}).
 *
 * IT IS THE SHORT FORM WHEREVER THE LONG ONE IS ONE NAVIGATION AWAY. This is the
 * surface an owner is looking at while they compare eight characters, so it
 * draws the one line that discharges §13.5 and the pointer at where the rest of
 * it is, rather than the long account.
 *
 * THAT POINTER IS A PROMISE ABOUT THE READER'S OWN SETTINGS DIALOG, so the
 * promise is checked before it is made. Settings → Security is owner-only in
 * hosted mode and fails closed while the role snapshot is stale, and this
 * component has no role gate of its own — it draws for whoever is holding a
 * locked `web-unsigned` channel. Asking `settingsSectionReachable` the same
 * question the settings nav asks is what stops a viewer, an operator, or an
 * owner mid-reconnect being sent to a section that is not in their list; where
 * the answer is no they get the long form here instead, so §2.2's no-pin reason
 * is never the thing behind a door they cannot open.
 *
 * THE ABSENCE OF A CODE IS ALSO A STATE THIS DRAWS. §13.5's duty is a display
 * duty and the derivation may fail without costing the channel, so a locked
 * `web-unsigned` channel can reach this surface holding nothing to compare.
 * Rendering `null` there kept the strongest claim this tier can make while the
 * only check behind it had silently gone missing; the sentence says so instead.
 * `null` remains the answer in every state that is not `web-unsigned`, because
 * there the channel has made no claim to qualify.
 *
 * The string is display state and stays that way: it is read from the in-memory
 * projection on every render and written nowhere. §13.5 — "never logged, never
 * persisted, never sent to analytics" — so there is no copy button, no `title`
 * attribute, and no form control whose value a browser could restore.
