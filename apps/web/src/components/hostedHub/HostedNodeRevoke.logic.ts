// Every decision and every owner-facing sentence behind revoking a node from
// the hosted directory.
//
// A `.logic.ts` sibling for the reason `HostedRelayTrustNotice.logic.ts` and
// `NodeSecuritySettings.logic.ts` are: a claim that could mislead an owner about
// what an irreversible action did belongs somewhere a node test can read it
// without a DOM, and under a prohibited-phrase scan. Nothing here imports React.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHAT REVOKING A NODE ACTUALLY DOES, READ OFF THE HUB
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `POST /api/admin/nodes/{nodeId}/revoke` runs one Hub-side transaction:
//
//   * `nodes.revoke` is `UPDATE nodes SET revoked_at=… WHERE id=? AND
//     revoked_at IS NULL`, so it is monotonic. Nothing in the Hub's persistence
//     layer ever writes `revoked_at=NULL` back onto a node row.
//   * `authorizedDirectoryEntry` returns `null` for a node with `revokedAt` set,
//     and `/api/nodes` is that function filtered — so the node leaves EVERY
//     authorized account's directory, not only the acting owner's, and cannot
//     come back.
//   * the revocation signal is an in-process bus. Its relay subscriber closes
//     channels the Hub already holds open and drops the node's own socket if one
//     is connected. There is no leg that contacts the machine.
//
// The last point is the whole reason this control exists, and it is also the
// easiest thing to lie about: a node that is offline, unreachable, or gone for
// good is revoked by exactly this call, on exactly this path. Nothing is sent to
// it, nothing on it changes, and it is not asked to agree.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// AND WHAT IT DOES NOT REACH, WHICH IS THE SAME FACT READ FORWARDS
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// "There is no leg that contacts the machine" is what makes this safe, and it is
// also why the copy may not describe it as a kill switch for the machine. The
// node keeps serving the clients that paired with it DIRECTLY: `ryco serve`
// hands out pairing credentials that `SessionCredentialService` exchanges for
// node-local sessions in the node's own table, with no coupling to any Hub
// revocation state, and `apps/server/src/server.ts` merges those auth routes and
// `hubConnectorRoutesLayer` into one router unconditionally. Cutting those takes
// `ryco auth` ON the machine.
//
// The node also keeps its local Hub identity, because the Hub wrote nothing to
// it. `HubConnector.resume()` early-returns on `revoked` and `enroll()` throws
// while an `activeNode` is on disk, so the only exit is `leave()` — surfaced to
// an owner as "Leave this Hub". An owner told to "enroll it again" and nothing
// else walks to the machine and hits a connector that refuses before a device
// code is ever issued.

 * What the owner is agreeing to, in the consequence's own terms.
 *
 * EVERY LINE IS SCOPED TO THE HUB, because that is the only thing this call
 * changes. An owner reaches for a control named "Revoke" on a machine they have
 * stopped trusting — a stolen laptop is the case — and the question they are
 * actually asking is "is that machine locked down now?". The answer is no: the
 * Hub door is shut and the machine's own door is untouched. A line that said
 * "everyone authorized on it" would answer yes, and would talk an owner out of
 * the one step that would help.
 *
 * `direct` states that boundary POSITIVELY rather than as a denial. The
 * prohibited-phrase scan below is a bare substring match and cannot tell a claim
 * from its negation, so "the node is not wiped" would trip it while also
 * planting the idea. Saying what remains true — the machine keeps serving its
 * own paired clients, and here is where those are managed — costs the owner
 * nothing to read and does not require the scan to be weakened.
 *
 * "Everyone" in `access` is load-bearing and is not a flourish. This route
 * revokes the NODE; the separate grant route revokes one account's access. An
 * owner who read this as "I lose my access to it" would be misinformed about a
 * change that reaches every account authorized through this Hub. `directory`
 * carries the same scope in its own words rather than borrowing it from the line
 * above: the two make different claims (grants, and the directory listing), and
 * the Hub guarantees both for every account.
 *
 * `return` names the machine-side step. After a Hub revocation the node still
 * holds its local Hub identity — `enroll()` throws while an `activeNode` exists
 * — so "enroll it again" on its own sends an owner to a machine that refuses
 * before it issues a device code, and reads as a Hub bug.
