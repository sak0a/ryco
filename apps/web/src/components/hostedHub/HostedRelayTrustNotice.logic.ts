// The hosted relay trust disclosure, as a FUNCTION OF THE CHANNEL STATE.
//
// It used to be one exported constant — "Hosted connections use WSS transport
// security, but they are not application-level end-to-end encrypted" — rendered
// unconditionally at five mount sites. That sentence was true of every web
// channel until this tier ran a §4 handshake. It is now false of a locked one,
// and a false sentence about confidentiality is the §2.2 defect read backwards:
// a surface that cannot change its claim cannot make an honest one either.
//
// SO THE CLAIM IS A SELECTOR, NOT A STRING, and this is a `.logic.ts` sibling
// for the reason `AccountSettings.logic.ts` is: a decision whose failure mode is
// security-relevant rather than cosmetic belongs somewhere a node test can reach
// it without a DOM. The five mount sites consume the selector through the
// component, which reads the live §13 projection itself, so there is no code
// path left that renders a claim the channel has outgrown.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHAT THIS COPY MAY NOT SAY
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every sentence below is a security claim, and `docs/relay-e2ee-protocol.md`
// bounds all of them:
//
// 1. **No stronger claim for a weaker configuration** (§2.2, §12.2). The
//    fallback state is called legacy and carries no E2EE or active-Hub wording;
//    the NX state is never spelled the way the signed native tier is.
// 2. **The web ceiling is stated, not implied** (§2.4). "The served web client
//    is never operator-proof … A malicious Hub may serve code that completes the
//    genuine node handshake, displays the genuine session `WebSAS`, and
//    separately exfiltrates plaintext or traffic keys." The `web-unsigned` copy
//    says exactly that, in those terms.
// 3. **The latch is described as what it is** (§2.3, §17.5). "The web disclosure
//    text MUST state the web bullet above. It MUST NOT describe the web latch as
//    durable, cross-session, or Hub-resistant" — and §17.5 adds that the web
//    latch and the durable native latch "MUST NOT be described in the same
//    terms". The copy says the opposite of durable, because that is what is true.
// 4. **§2.2's web row denies the active-Hub column TWICE**, and the copy owes
//    both: "the Hub can originate an unsigned NX session **and** controls the
//    served code". The second needs a substituted bundle; the FIRST DOES NOT.
//    §8.10's NX rows are the structural fact — client→node is "never
//    authenticated at the Noise level … a Hub can originate an NX session", and
//    node→client encrypts "to an **anonymous ephemeral initiator** — any active
//    party, including the Hub, could be that initiator" — and this tier holds no
//    pin of any kind (§6.3, §13.1, §2.3's web bullet) with which to tell the two
//    apart. Copy that named only the served-code case left honest served code as
//    the sole stated condition, so a reader with no reason to doubt the bundle
//    concluded the Hub was outside the channel. It is not.
//
// `HostedRelayTrustNotice.logic.test.ts` scans every string here for the phrases
// those rules forbid. The scan is a bare substring match and therefore cannot
// tell a claim from its negation, so this module does not use the banned words
// at all — including in the negative. "Never operator-proof" is written as
// "cannot protect against the Hub operator", which is §13.5's own phrasing and
// carries no token a future edit could strand in the affirmative.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// AND IT MAY NOT POINT AT WHAT THE SURFACE UNDER IT DOES NOT DRAW
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This notice mounts at five sites across BOTH presentation tiers, and §13.5's
// `WebSAS` renders at exactly one of them (the desktop node menu; `AGENTS.md`
// freezes the web phone tier, so the phone connection sheet draws none). Copy
// here therefore states the ceiling without presupposing a comparison value on
// the page: a sentence about "the same session code" read identically on that
// sheet, telling a reader they held a check they did not have. The pointer at
// the comparison lives WITH the comparison, in `HostedE2eeVerification.logic.ts`,
// which by construction renders only where the characters do.
// `HostedRelayTrustNotice.logic.test.ts` scans these bodies for that reference so
// the coupling cannot come back.
