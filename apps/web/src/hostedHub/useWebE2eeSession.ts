 * plaintext downgrade and a locked NX channel identically — both `Online`, both
 * with the connected glyph — which is precisely the retained downgrade exposure
 * of the compatibility window going unlabeled.
 *

 * native rows are not merely unused here but unrepresentable: §2.2's bottom row
 * may never be spelled by a client whose JavaScript the Hub serves.
 *
 * Narrowed to the one field so a change to any other part of the projection —
 * §13.5's code in particular — does not re-render a connection pill.

 * "ephemeral display state: never logged, never persisted, never sent to

 * there is no accessor that hands it to anything but a component. A caller
 * cannot say what channel the code belongs to from this hook alone — that is
 * {@link useWebE2eeChannelStatus}'s answer, and the surface gates on it, because
 * the §4.4 machine publishes the code from inside its own `e2ee` lock and the
 * projection is still reporting `negotiating` at that instant.
