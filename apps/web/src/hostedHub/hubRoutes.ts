/**
 * The Hub website's own routes.
 *
 * Every Hub screen used to be a `useState` discriminator inside one component:
 * sign-in, the four signup stages, password login, the reset ceremony,
 * invitation redemption, first-owner setup and the node directory all lived at
 * `/` with no address. That cost the three things a website is expected to do —
 * a refresh restored nothing, Back left the Hub entirely instead of stepping
 * back through a flow, and no page could be linked or bookmarked.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a TanStack route tree
 *
 * The hosted build already replaces the router's history with
 * {@link installHostedNodeHistory}, which maps `/node/<id>/<logical>` onto the
 * unchanged logical route tree, and `routes/__root.tsx` short-circuits the
 * router in hosted mode — `HostedHubRoot` is what renders for every pathname
 * that is not `/pair` or `/native/authorize/*`. Adding file routes for the Hub
 * would mean regenerating the shared route tree, re-pathing surfaces the node
 * app also matches, and giving ten hosted browser suites a real `RouterProvider`
 * they currently mock. It would buy nothing a visitor could perceive: this
 * module reads and writes the same history, so the URLs, the history entries
 * and the Back behaviour are identical either way.
 *
 * ## Reserved pathnames
 *
 * `/email-verification`, `/password-reset` and `/public-signup/verify` are a
 * Hub **server** contract: the Hub builds them from its configured public origin
 * in mail bodies. They are used verbatim as this module's route paths rather
 * than redirected, so a mailed link and the page it lands on are the same
 * address, and a reload of one lands on a page that says what to do instead of
 * "this link is incomplete or expired".
 *
 * No route carries authorization material. Link tokens arrive in the URL
 * *fragment* and are consumed and scrubbed by `hostedIdentityLinks.ts` before
 * anything else reads the location; nothing here writes a secret to a pathname,
 * a search parameter or a history entry.
