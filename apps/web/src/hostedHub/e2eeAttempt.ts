// Where the WEB tier's §4.4 attempt is resolved — docs/relay-e2ee-protocol.md
// §4.4 (every selection guard evaluable before the channel receives any
// payload), §12.1/§12.1.1 (the in-memory latch and the degenerate web mapping),
// §8.1/§8.5 (NX, and the credentials the hello carries), §14.5 (the CSPRNG check
// that gates E2EE at all).
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHY THIS TIER'S RESOLUTION IS SYNCHRONOUS AND THE NATIVE ONE IS NOT
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `createRelaySocket` is synchronous — the shared transport calls it the instant
// a ticket resolves — and §4.4 requires the latch guard to be answerable "before
// it has received any payload". `apps/mobile` cannot meet that inline: its
// guards live in a keychain and a secure store, so it resolves an attempt AHEAD
// of the socket and reads it from a slot. This tier has nothing to read. §12.1's
// latch is a bit in this process's memory, §12.1.1's web mapping is latched-or-
// legacy-eligible and nothing else, §8.5's NX credentials are the single literal
// `{ tier: "web" }`, and §13.1 gives web no pin. Every guard is therefore
// resolvable in the call itself, and there is no warm-up path, no slot, and no
// race between a decision and the channel it governs.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, AND WHY EACH ABSENCE IS THE CORRECT ANSWER
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   * `verifiedPin` — §13.1: web holds no durable pin of any kind. Passing one
//     would be inventing a trust anchor for §8.3 elements 9 and 17.
//   * `onUnexpectedNode` — §12.1.1: "Web never produces an _unexpected_
//     selection, and consequently never raises §13.2.1." Rows K23/K24 are
//     unreachable here, so a handler for them would be a surface with no
//     reachable cause.
//   * `accountId` — §8.3 and §12.1.1: the account scope is a NATIVE resolution
//     input; "the web tier has none". It is still read here, because §12.1 keys
//     the latch on it — but the latch key is client-local state and element 10 of
//     the statement context is not, and conflating them would put a Hub-issued
//     value into the handshake context on a tier §8.3 defines without one.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `legacyPermitted` IS TRUE, AND IT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// §12.1.1: "Strict mode is an opt-in, never automatic, and it is recorded per
// Hub origin… It MUST be recorded and evaluated under `hubOrigin` alone." Web has
// no durable store to record one in (§6.3, §13.1), so no opt-in can exist, so
// the policy this tier evaluates is the default — legacy permitted. `false` would
// not be a stricter reading of the same rule; it would be a strict mode nobody
// opted into, and the §11.2 P18/P19 guards would then make every genuinely
// un-upgraded node unreachable during exactly the compatibility window §12.3's
// default-`false` `requireE2EE` exists to protect.
