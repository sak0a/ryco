# Resource monitor

The isolated Rust process collects CPU, resident/virtual memory, process identity, and OS I/O counters. It retains bounded in-memory history. The server starts it on first diagnostics use, validates its versioned protocol, and treats unavailable collection as a diagnostics warning rather than a server failure. Command arguments are deliberately excluded.

Adapted from `pingdotgg/t3code` commit `de28fa1ff3ac3c3a96bebd9ec5ce23dd09f61af0`; see [LICENSE](LICENSE). The upstream application and install scripts are not dependencies.

## Build

Install the pinned toolchain without changing your default Rust version:

```sh
rustup toolchain install 1.95.0 --profile minimal
```

From the repository root, `bun run build` and `bun run build:desktop` build the monitor with the locked Cargo dependencies. To build it alone:

```sh
bun scripts/build-resource-monitor.ts
```

The helper also accepts an architecture (`arm64`, `x64`, or macOS `universal`) and platform (`darwin`, `linux`, `win32`). Cross builds require the corresponding Rust target and linker; they never silently substitute a host binary. Linux targets use GNU libc. Runtime collection fails gracefully when the binary is incompatible or unavailable.

Desktop packaging unpacks the executable outside Electron's ASAR archive. Release jobs collect architecture-specific binaries into the CLI package, so the runtime selects a local platform binary without downloading executable code. Native source changes invalidate build caches.

## Checks

```sh
cd native/resource-monitor
cargo test --locked
```

TypeScript tests cover protocol limits, timeouts, startup cancellation, retry, power-sensitive sampling, PID reuse, and safe signaling. The OS may restrict process counters; unavailable metrics must remain distinguishable from measured data.
